# just-cook-it-app

The Just Cook It Recipe project (Made by Julio Bell) is based on the original project (Forkify Recipe App) by Jonas Schmedtmann's The Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy. This app allows users to search for recipes using the Food2Fork API. Users can view the recipe along with the cook time and also increase or decrease the amount of servings they need. At this point the user can favorite the recipe, add the recipe ingredients to their shopping list if they want to shop for more than one recipe. Favorite recipes are stored in local storage so no database was required for this application.

# Technologies Used

## HTML5 & CSS3

The layout was carefully designed using CSS3 BEM naming convention. CSS-Grid was used to comply with the newest standards of development.

## JavaScript

No frameworks were used in the development of this application. All functionality was built with vanilla ES6 JavaScript so feel free to dive into the code.

## Webpack & Babel

Webpack was used as the module bundler to incorporate Axios for fetching as well as BABEL for compiling the next-gen JavaScript.

## Node JS

Node.js was used for building a HTTP server. 

## Heroku

We used the cloud-based Heroku Platform to deploy and run the app.
